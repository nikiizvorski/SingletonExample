# SingletonExample in Android Game of Words

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 
This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. In this project you will find how you can
use singleton to create all object inside the Singleton Class and get instance of that object while re-creating it in the middle of your
Application Creation showing the User a SplashScreen in the middle of PreviewClass! Good example how to do your large reading while
the user is waiting on a splash screen against using that inside of AsyncTask. And Loading all the massive data inside of a HashMap
then passing the instance of the Singleton class in the needed activity.
